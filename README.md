# [Project 1: Password Strength Predictor: Project Overview ](https://github.com/AminOtusanya/Amin_Portfolio/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20-%20Password%20Strenght!.ipynb)
* Created a tool to Predict the category of Password whether it is Strong, Good or Weak
* Got the data from "Data Science Real World Projects" on Udemy
* Engineered my data using TFIDF Vectorizers
* Optimized Logistic Regression using RandomSearchCV to reach the best model

# [Project 2: Develop an Machine Learning model to predict Fare of Airlines at various Routes :Project Overview](https://github.com/AminOtusanya/Amin_Portfolio/blob/main/Flight%20time%20predictions.ipynb)
* Created a tool to predict flight prices based on the various routes & airlines used 
* Got the data from "Data Science Real World Porjects" on Udemy 
* Engineered my data from csv to python & converted strings to machine understanding language 
* Optimized Randsom Forest regressor, Linear regressor using RandomizedSearchCV to reach the best model
