# [Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview](https://github.com/AminOtusanya/ds_salary_proj)
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE -$27k) to help data scinetists negotiate thier income when they get a job. 
* Collected from Kaggle
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value compnies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 
* Built a client facing API using flask 

# [Project 2: Developed a Machine Learning model to predict Fare of Airlines at various Routes :Project Overview](https://github.com/AminOtusanya/Amin_Portfolio/blob/main/Flight%20time%20predictions.ipynb)
* Created a tool to predict flight prices based on the various routes & airlines used 
* Got the data from "Data Science Real World Projects" on Udemy 
* Engineered my data from csv to python & converted strings to machine understanding language 
* Optimized Randsom Forest regressor, Linear regressor using RandomizedSearchCV to reach the best model.
